### About Wild in Words

Wild in Words is a digital blog series aimed to transforms curiosity into connection through fun facts, heartfelt stories, and surprising science about plants and animals both local and global. By spotlighting species in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, Wild in Words encourages readers to care more deeply and act more boldly in support of conservation. It also connects audiences with further resources, including conservation groups, Indigenous knowledge, and citizen science initiatives.

### Our Mission

To spark wonder for the natural world by:

- **Humanizing Conservation:** Sharing relatable tales of species.
- **Bridging Urban & Wild:** Linking Vancouver's common species to deep-dive stories, spot a species on your commute, then explore its life here!
- **Inspiring Action:** Turning "I never knew!" into "How can I help?"
