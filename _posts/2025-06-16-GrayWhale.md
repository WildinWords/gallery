> Off the coast of Tofino, Vancouver, a spectacular natural show unfolds every year—the migration of gray whales. These massive creatures glide slowly along the shoreline, as if whispering their ancient and mysterious tales to humanity.

# *The "Marathon Champions" of Migration*

Gray whales are the champions of animal migration! Every year, they travel along the western coast of North America, making a round trip between the freezing feeding grounds of Alaska and the warm breeding areas of Baja California in Mexico. The entire journey is over 16,000 kilometers long, almost half the circumference of the Earth! Off the coast of Vancouver, during spring and autumn, lucky whale watchers often spot their huge figures, spouting tall sprays of water as if saying hello to people.

# *The Playful "Oceanic Spirits"*

Gray whales aren't just huge, clumsy beasts. They can be playful and cute. During their migration, it's common to see them leap out of the water and splash back down, an action known as "breaching". Sometimes, they play near boats, showing their smooth backs and interacting with humans, as if inviting us to join their oceanic party.

# *The "Big Foodie" of the Sea*

Despite their massive size, gray whales have a super interesting feeding method! They swim on their sides close to the ocean floor, using their baleen to filter small creatures from the sediment, just like a giant "seafloor vacuum cleaner." When feeding, a cloud of "sediment" rises from the ocean floor, creating a spectacular scene. This unique feeding behavior not only fills their bellies but also stirs up nutrients on the ocean floor, nourishing the entire marine ecosystem.

# *The Ocean's "Jet Sprayers"*

When gray whales surface to breathe (known as "spout"), they shoot water 4 metres into the air, just like oceanic jet sprayers. But it's not for show. Before each dive, they replace 90% of the air in their lungs. If you watch closely, each whale's spray pattern is unique—like their own ID card. Scientists use these "heart-shaped" spout to recognize gray whales.

# *The Skin "Garden"*

Take a closer look at a gray whale, and you'll find its skin is like a "moving garden". It's densely covered with barnacles, whale lice, and other tiny creatures make homes on its skin. These little creatures treat the whale as a "free cruise ship" and travel around with it. For gray whales, although these attachments are a bit "burdensome", they are like a suit of "armor". They can even be used as weapons during fights! Sometimes, they even rub against rocks to shake off the excess "tenants."

# Once Threatened "Devil Fish"

Once, gray whale populations plummeted due to overhunting, and its aggressive reactions when harpooned gave them the nickname of "devil fish." Today, while conservation efforts have helped their numbers recover somewhat, new threats like ocean pollution and climate change still threaten their survival. The next time when you meet those "Ocean Travelers" at the coast of Vancouver, don't forget to wave at them while protect their blue home!
