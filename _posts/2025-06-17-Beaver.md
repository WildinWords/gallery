In Canada, a beaver named “Willie” became a star. It appeared alone in a pond in a city park and started to build a dam. At first, people were worried that it was destroying the ecosystem and planned to move it. But Willie stubbornly resisted, even biting the staff, which instead impressed people with its tenacity. Local residents launched a “Save Willie” campaign, and after heated discussions, the government finally agreed to let Willie stay where he was. Willie not only managed to stay, but also subsequently attracted a partner, they together in the city park to reproduce offspring, become a good story of harmony between man and nature .

# The Amazing Story of the Beaver

Nature's hydraulic engineers: Beavers are the animal kingdom's top “architects” and “hydraulic engineers”. They gnaw off trees with their teeth, and then use branches, mud, and rocks to build dams that can raise the water level of streams by several meters to form vast ponds. For example, a beaver dam in Montana, USA, is 700 meters long and is an architectural marvel in the animal kingdom. Not only do the dams provide safe shelter for beavers, but they also create habitat for a wide range of organisms, contributing to a thriving ecosystem.
Unique 'scent card': Beavers have special scent glands that secrete a substance called 'beaver scent'. They mark territories by applying beaver scent to mud piles. This scent not only serves as a declaration of territory, but also conveys information about the beaver's health, gender, and other information, just like their “scent business card”.
The Mystery of Teeth: The beaver's teeth are called “God's tools” and are not only exceptionally sharp, but they will continue to grow. The outer layer of their incisors is hard, orange-red enamel, while the interior is softer dentine. When gnawing, the softer part wears down faster, keeping the incisors in the shape of sharp chisels at all times, helping them to easily gnaw down thick trees .

# Beavers and Folklore

In the legends of the Native Americans of North America, the beaver is a symbol of wisdom. It is said that in ancient times, when mankind was flooded, the beaver taught the people to build dams to withstand the floods. The beaver also taught people how to build houses to help them survive in harsh environments. Therefore, many tribes regarded the beaver as a sacred animal, and the image of the beaver often appeared in totems and rituals.

# Survival status and ecological value of the beaver

Beavers were once hunted and killed in large numbers because of their valuable fur and the medicinal value of beaver scent, and their numbers were drastically reduced. In Europe, the beaver was almost extinct until conservation measures were implemented. Today, beavers play an important role in ecological restoration. The dams they build can regulate water flow and reduce flooding; the wetland environment they form can purify water quality and increase biodiversity. For example, the reintroduction of beavers in the United Kingdom has improved the water quality of some rivers and significantly increased the number of birds, fish and other species in the surrounding area.
